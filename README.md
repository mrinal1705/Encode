# Encode
Django website for encryption and decryption of messages




In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key the same size as, or longer than, the message being sent. 

Python includes a module for one-time-pad cipher implementation. The package name is called One-Time-Pad which includes a command line encryption tool that uses encryption mechanism similar to the one-time pad cipher algorithm.

So i used this module to encrypt the incoming messages through http requests and return the encrypted string to the user and vice-versa.
For backend i used django framework and for front end i used Bootstrap and html.
